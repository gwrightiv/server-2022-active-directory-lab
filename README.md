# Windows Server 2022 On-Prem Active Directory Lab

This project demonstrates a complete deployment of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) using **Windows Server 2022** hosted locally in **VirtualBox** on my iMac.

The lab includes:
- Promotion of a Windows Server 2022 to a Domain Controller
- Joining a Windows 11 client to the domain
- OU and security group design
- GPO implementation for folder redirection and desktop wallpaper
- Shared folder access control with documented permission results
- Subnetting and network configuration

This project builds on my previous cloud-based AD experience in Azure and reflects the ability to manage on-prem enterprise environments.

## 🔄 Progression of Skills

This project represents the foundation of my Active Directory experience:

- [✔] **On-prem AD DS** using Windows Server 2022 in VirtualBox on my iMac (this project)
- [✔] **Azure-based AD DS** with domain join, VM deployment, and role assignments
- [🔜] Next goal: **Hybrid AD** with Azure AD Connect, Group Sync, and MFA
