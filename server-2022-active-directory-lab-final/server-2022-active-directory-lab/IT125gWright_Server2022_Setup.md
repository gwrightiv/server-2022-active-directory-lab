# Server 2022 Setup & Domain Controller Promotion

## Overview
This lab involved setting up a Windows Server 2022 machine in VirtualBox on a local iMac and promoting it to a Domain Controller for the domain `gwright.local`.

## Steps Taken
1. Installed Server 2022 in VirtualBox using NAT networking.
2. Verified IP config with `ipconfig`.
3. Used Server Manager to install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
4. Promoted the server to a domain controller with the domain name `gwright.local`.
5. Verified domain promotion via Server Manager and system properties.
