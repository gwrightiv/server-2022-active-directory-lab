# OU Structure & Shared Folder Access Controls

## Overview
Created an organizational unit structure and used group-based access control to secure shared folders.

## OU Structure
- `Sales` OU: `GrahamSalesbody`
- `Marketing` OU: `GrahamMarketer`
- `Managers` OU: `GrahamBoss`

## Shared Folder Permissions
- `Graham Marketing` folder: accessible by Marketers and Managers
- `Graham Sales` folder: accessible by Sales and Managers

## Verification
- Marketer can access only marketing folder
- Salesbody can access only sales folder
- Boss can access both

## Screenshot Highlights
- OU structure in Active Directory Users and Computers
- File Explorer access results from various user perspectives

## Notes
This showcases real-world access control modeling using AD group memberships.
